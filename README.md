Hi, I'm Maida Syed, a student at FAST University pursuing a BS in Computer Science.
I have a strong passion for programming and am currently learning C language.
My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, and Node.js. I'm also experienced with databases like Firebase and MongoDB.
Programming is not just a career path for me; it's a true passion. ðŸ˜Š
